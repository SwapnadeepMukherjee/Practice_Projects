# Interviewer: Sri Ram ...

# Dsiclaimer before starting:

# 1. Take examples when explaining any conceptual topic.
# 2. Since you are experienced profosssional in this area, it will be helpful/more meaningful if we can quote your experience in every answer while answering the use-case.

# In short, make your answer crisp, more meaningful, take examples to explain, quote your experience.

# 1. Introduce yourself with relevant experience in accordance with your JD.
# 2. Explain OOPs concepts any three for example Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance with quoting where you implemented in your BAU project?
# 3. Are you familar with design patterns? If so explain which design patterns you have used with quoting where you implemented in your BAU project?
# 4. Have you deployed any AI/Model so far in your experience? 
# 5. Do you also have exprience in CI/CD pipeline?
# 6. Do you also have exprience in Docker?
# 7. Did you ever work with Mircoservices/Monitoring microservices?
# 8. Did every work on code-optimisiation or API-Optimisation for performance?
# 9. Did you use Rust anytime before?
# 10. Scenario-1: Team is tasked with building a FastAPI-based backend service. It exposes predictions from a trained model. During testing it was found that the model takes around 6-seconds per request which is not acceptable as per design. The acceptable time per request as per design should be 2-seconds per request. How would you handle this sitatuion to improve latency keeping the API scalable? : First, we would start by findings where the bottleneck lies using tools. At a high-level, we can start by batching the request. We could further introduce end-points in fast-API to increase concurrency. 
# 11. Scenario-2: Reviewing developer's code and noticed has that the developer has placed all the database queries and business logic in a single-file. Whenever we are trying to test the service, it's hard to test and hard to extend. You are expected give feedback to the developer. 
# 12. Design a REST-API based service / product (SaaS), tell your approach.

# Feedback and Suggestions:

# 1. Underprepared for the conversation.
# 2. AI/ML related concepts were a key part of the conversation.
# 3. Approach, Commns is good but needs to be a more crisp, to the point and use techninal jargons.
# 4. Prepare scenario's based on the discussion.
