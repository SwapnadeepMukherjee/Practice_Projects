# Then moved to Monday(July 21st): 7pm to 8pm IST and finally happened on 7.30pm - 8.30pm IST

# First 15-minutes started with a  brief introduction about each other, then started the formal interview process:

# Interviewer Name: Shivam Chabbra

# 	1. Tell me recently about 1/2 projects of yours and explain in details.
# 	2. Follow-up question: how did you configure your secrets in your Jenkins server?
# 	3. Imagine you have huge dataset and we havse setup a Python code that is giving out correct output that is designed with nested loops only. How do you optimize the code? : Pandas, Numpy, List Comprehension, â€¦
# 	4. How will you design a Python application using Docker and write a docker file such that you don't have to manage pipeline manually and the dockerfile itself manages the sync between Production and non-production code? What are the parameters that you will use?
# 	5. Design a custom exception that will define something and show the output by using it in a function in python.

#   Answer to question 5:

#   Custom execptions in Python allow us to create our specific error types to handle situations unique to out application domain. 
#   This can improve code quality, make error handling much more granular and enchacnce reusability.
